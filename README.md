Neighborhood Map project (Emirates Stadium)
*******************************************
I am a resident of Panchkula, India but it is my dream to visit the
Emirates Stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club, of which I'm
a big supporter. Hence I've chosen a part of North London for this project.



Project details are as follows :-


1. First of all extract the zip file to your local machine.

2. This project makes use of Bootsrap, Jquery and Knockout JS libraries
and ofcourse the Google Map APIs. https://developers.google.com/maps/

3. This project also makes use of a third part API Foursqaure to fetch
details and photos for the Infowindow of markers.
https://developer.foursquare.com/

4. Simply open project.html in your favorite browser to run the application.

5. The page contains 5 location markers as a list near the Arsenal Football Club
situated in North London, UK.

6. Click on any of the loaction on the list to get full address and a photo
of that particular place. This also changes the color of selected marker from
red to yellow.

7. There's a search bar as well to search for any location from the list. You
can also play around with the map in full screen mode.
